/* Write your own program similar to the one in Figure 7.15 that also has at least one register forwarded from 
the Memory stage, one register forwarded from the Writeback stage, one register that doesnâ€™t require 
forwarding, one stall, and one flush on a taken branch.  Use different instructions in a different order 
than 7.15.  Sketch a diagram like 7.15 showing what each pipeline stage does in each cycle while handling 
each */
